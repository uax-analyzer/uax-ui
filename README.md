# UAX Dashboard
This is a dashboard built to aid visualizing the metrics' results generated by [UAX](https://github.com/uax-analyzer/uax) tool.

## Install
The repository is going to be uploaded at NPM; until then, just `$ git clone` the repository and run, within the tool's root folder, the following command in the terminal, before actually running the tool, to install all the dependencies:

```console
$ npm install
```

### Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v.18 or above

## Running
```console
$ node index --input-path <dir> [--port <number>]
```

where:
* input-path (short version `-i`): it is the path pointing to the folder where the results of UAX were generated.
* port (short version `-p`): it is the port used by the web server where the dashboard can be accessed. It is optional and its default value is 3000.
